Primarily these are the following data types in Python:
1. Integers --> whole numbers -ve infinity to positive infinity
2. Floating point numbers --> intergers decimal numbers
3. Strings --> string is the letters and sentences 
4. Booleans --> values into true and false 
5. None

OPERATORS IN PYTHON
Following are some common operators in python:
1. Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, / etc.
2. Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, == etc.
3. Comparison operators: ==, >, >=, <, != etc.
4. Logical operators: and, or, not.

List and tuple
List is mutable 

l1 = [1,8,7,2,21,15]
• l1.sort(): updates the list to [1,2,7,8,15,21]
• l1.reverse(): updates the list to [15,21,2,7,8,1]
• l1.append(8): adds 8 at the end of the list
• l1.insert(3,8): This will add 8 at 3 index
• l1.pop(2): Will delete element at index 2 and return its value.
• l1.remove(21): Will remove 21 from the list.

TUPLES IN PYTHON
A tuple is an immutable data type in python.

a = () # empty tuple
a = (1,) # tuple with only one element needs a comma
a = (1,7,2) # tuple with more than one element
TUPLE METHODS

Consider the following tuple.
18
a = (1, 7, 2)
 a.count (1): a count (1) will return number of times 1 occurs in a.
 a.index (1) will return the index of first occurrence of 1 in a.


Dictionary
Dictonary is a collection of keys-value pairs.

Syntax:
a = {
"key": "value",
"harry": "code",
"marks": "100",
"list": [1, 2, 9]
}

PROPERTIES OF PYTHON DICTIONARIES
1. It is unordered.
2. It is mutable.
3. It is indexed.
4. Cannot contain duplicate keys

sets
If you are a programming beginner without much knowledge of mathematical
operations on sets, you can simply look at sets in python as data types containing
unique values.
PROPERTIES OF SETS
1. Sets are unordered => Element’s order doesn’t matter
2. Sets are unindexed => Cannot access elements by index
3. There is no way to change items in sets.
4. Sets cannot contain duplicate values.

if (condition1): # if condition1 is True
print ("yes")
elif(condition2): # if condition2 is True
print("no")
else: # otherwise
print("maybe")
