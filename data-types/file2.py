RELATIONAL OPERATORS

Relational Operators are used to evaluate conditions inside the if statements. Some
examples of relational operators are:

==: equals.
> =: greater than/ equal to.
< =: lesser than/ equal to.

LOGICAL OPERATORS
In python logical operators operate on conditional statements. For Example:
• and  true if both operands are true else false.
• or  true if at least one operand is true or else false.
• not inverts true to false & false to true.


ELIF CLAUSE

elif in python means [else if]. An if statements can be chained together with a lot of
these elif statements followed by an else statement.
if (condition1):
#code
elif (condition2): # this ladder will stop once a condition in an if or
elif is met.
#code
elif(condition3):
#code
else:
#code


IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. There can be any number of elif statements.
2. Last else is executed only if all the conditions inside elifs fail.
